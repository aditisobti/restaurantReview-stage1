## Prerequisites

1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.

## Instructions
Open Git bash window on your terminal.

Git clone https://github.com/aditisobti/[TBD].git.

Go to the folder where the code is downloaded on the terminal.

Run the following command 'python -m http.server 8000'

Go to Chrome or Edge browser with the following URL http://localhost:8000.

First try in full desktop and browse through the website. Checkout things related to accessibility for like Keyboard navigation and event handling.

To validate responsive behavior in Chrome, go to developer tools (F12). You can use Ctrl + Shift + M to toggle between desktop and Responsive options. I recommend that you try with IPhone X or IPhone 5 or Galaxy S5 while on responsive state for the browser.

To try offline mode. Disconnect your machine from the n/w and try browsing the page. You should still the content as expected but maps may not work.
